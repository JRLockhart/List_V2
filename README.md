# List_V2
This form will show the contents of two Deck objects. When the program is first run, Deck 1 will create a random deck while deck2 will contain a complete deck of 52 cards. Both are sorted by suit and then Value. You can reset either deck with the appropriote button and even send one card to the other deck using the << and >> buttons.
